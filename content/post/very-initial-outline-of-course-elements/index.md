# "It's only going to get worse" 

## Quote from: Barack Obama, Janet Napolitano, António Guterres, Joe Biden, John Kerry, the IPCC, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, John Holdren, Stephen Chu, Jennifer Granholm, Greta Thunberg

### All members of [PCAST: President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/22/president-biden-announces-members-of-presidents-council-of-advisors-on-science-and-technology/),  including present  and past members from Berkeley--Saul Perlmutter, Inez Fung, Bill Joy,  Birgitta Whaley, Susan Graham, Ed Penhoet, Eric Schmidt, John Holdren, Mario Molina*, Wayne Clough, Daniel Schrag--agree. 

#### This survey of materials and resources might help link readings, course offerings, groups of investigators, research results, and practical planning exercises. 

- Here's the red-flag: [UN Report: 2021](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/reports)
####  Your possible Spring Course focus
  - To convey the messages of *How Safe Are We?*, I extracted some elements to link to other ideas (very preliminary playing around). I'm using you as inspiration to bring some ideas together :
    - how to minimize the impact of climate change on the built environment: **fragile human systems critical for life**. 
      - Water
      - Energy 
      - Shelter
      - Transport
      - Health
      - Communications
      - Security

    - Question: *How should we think and act to mitigate climate change impact on our water, food, energy, shelter, information flow, emergency management, air quality--what people need to live in their communities*.
    - Question: *What organizations and institutions play central roles? Who runs them? What are their controlling goals, cultures, world-views, legal and financial environments?  *

#### Course audiences
  - The course can be a guide to analysis and action for **practitioners**, who need practical tools to:

     - decide what is true
    -  build projections of likely outcomes, based on causal analysis, ie, data, science and engineering
    - revise projections in light of facts, as free from noise and bias as possible
     - assess risks and prioritize actions 
    - coordinate action across all actors  at all levels 
    - generate and maintain public support
    - marshall and allocate necessary resources from public and private entities.
    - Answer:  *Why, what, who, when, where, how, how much*

  - Immediate audience 
    - Goldman School
      - (MPP), (MPA), (MDP)
      - (PhD)
    - UCB grad and undergrad  (or UC-wide)

# Critical Infrastructure Course

* What might a class do as an exercise? 
  -SCIF containment simulation--or power out, water out, wifi blocked, batteries dying--; 
- Deal with an unfolding situation, with assigned roles and responsibilities......and a principal shows up. Think Steve Chu arriving at the Operation Center and informing them he's going to spend several days in the room.
  - Images of [Kibera](http://kiberawater.com), Haitian encampment, the Martian:  Matt Damon in wrecked station, Space Station, lifeboat
  - Images of street markings on Berkeley streets showing [Call -811 survey of all US streets](https://call811.com/); use GIS  of underground piping in a city, with dispatch choosing among specific system failures
  - [Underground: David Macaulay](https://www.amazon.com/Underground-David-Macaulay/dp/0395340659): how it works-- NY underground: make streets disappear.....
  - list: how quickly do you die from
  		- Radiation
  		- Polluted Air
  			- Water
  			- Food
  			- Security; walls, personal defense; 
                        - Fire; Flood
- How much do you know about what you need to keep systems functioning? 
  - How it works
  - What it needs
  - Who makes, operates, maintains it
  - Use examples from home as practical, personal queries:
  - How much water did you use yesterday? Power? Bandwidth:? 
  - How many times were you probed? Port-scanned? 
    - Find app that shows probes in real time.  Who would know? 
    - Security scan of all class devices
  			- Tsutomu Shimomura?   Oregon design group? Where did they go? 
 - How do you learn about what you need: How do you decide?
  		- \[[Saul Perlman]] \[[Sense, Sensibility, Science]] course examining decision-making with inadequate information, using available flawed tools in a democratic setting.
- Making the Invisible Visible
  - visual metaphor: luminance, frequency range
  	- night-vision goggles
  	- instrumentation to show reality; cosmologists, astronomers
 - [**Daniel Kahneman** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CFjERpwFys)
   - psychological experiments to show[[Noise]] ,  slow-walking; 
  		- audio metaphor: making the inaudible audible
  		- tasting the air....dog olofactory--Covid, cancer, molecules in air, water-- 2.5 micron--
  		- simply by making the invisible visible does not mean that humans

### Problem

* see the flows
* know the flows
* Small intervention: results in all flows lost --without "seeing" interactions, not understandable, not interrelated (active verb)
* is vs do; am vs act; noun vs verb, passive vs active; Fowler; EB White;
- [EO Wilson: Save Half Earth](https://eowilsonfoundation.org/)
* scale: [[ Edward O Wilson]]; 
* become "visonary": become \[[Richard Feynman]] ; Daniel Kahneman; 
* extend understanding of ♲;

### Trace the flows

* Trace an electron
* Trace a drop of water
* Hydrological cycle; California flows cannot be separated from global flows; 
  		- track air moisture differential; show changes ;
* Truck roll
  		- long distance
  		- short distance
* Chart who owns; who pays taxes.......Fed, State, Local....
