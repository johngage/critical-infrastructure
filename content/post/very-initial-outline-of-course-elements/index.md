* Course focus
  		- If the course conveys the message of the book,  it outlines how to minimize the impact of climate change on the human systems that are critical for life. 
  		- It answers the question, "How should we think and act to mitigate climate change impact on our air, water, food, energy, shelter, information flow, emergency management
* Intended audiences for course
  		- The course, then, is a guide to action for **practitioners**--how to decide what is true, how to assess risks and prioritize actions, how to marshall and shape coordinated action across all actors  at all levels,  how to generate and maintain public support, and how to summon and allocate necessary resources from public and private entities.\
  			- Why, what, who, when, where, how
  		- Goldman School MPP, MPA, MPDev
  		- UC B undergrad  (or UC-wide)
  		- Practicioners: utilities, 

# Critical Infrastructure Course

* Example
  		- Once everyone is in room--power out, water out,  wifi blocked; SCIF containment
  		- Images of Kibera,  Haitian encampment, the Martian, Space Station, lifeboat
  		- Images of street markings on Berkeley streets showing 1-811? mapping of underground pipes
  			- image of NY under ground: make streets disappear.....
  		- list in order: how quickly do you die from
  			- Radiation
  			- Air
  			- Water
  			- Food
  			- Security; walls, personal defense, strict hierarchy; captain; physical strength, Alpha
* How much do you know about what you need? 
  		- How it works
  		- What it needs
  		- Who makes, operates, maintains it
  		- Use examples from home as queriee
  			- How much water did you use yesterday? Power? Bandwidth:? 
  			- How many times were you probed? Port-scanned? 
  				- Find app that shows probes in real time.  Who would know? 
  				- Security scan of all class devices
  			- Tsutomu?   Oregon? Where did they go? 
* How do you learn about what you need: How do you decide?
  		- \[[Saul Perlman]] \[[Sense, Sensibility, Science]]
* Making the Invisible Visible
  		- visual metaphor: luminance, frequency range
  			- night-vision goggles
  			- instrumentation to show reality; cosmologists, astronomers
  			- psychological experiments to show \[[Noise]],  slow-walking; 
  		- audio metaphor: making the inaudible audible
  		- tasting the air....dog olofactory--Covid, cancer, molecules in air, water-- 2.5 micron--
  		- simply by making the invisible visible does not mean that humans

### Problem

* see the flows
* know the flows
* all the flows are lost --not understandable, not interrelated (active verb)
* is vs do; am vs act; noun vs verb, passive vs active; Fowler; EB White;
* scale: be\[[ Edward O Wilson]]; 
* become "visonary": become \[[Richard Feynman]] ; Kahneman; 
* extend understanding of â™²; 

### Tools

* ```

  ```

### Actions

### Costs

### Who's Responsible

* Public
* Private

### Who is a resource?

* Current faculty in relevant disciplines
  		- Engineering
  		- Chemistry
  		- Physics
  		- Biochem, bioengineering
  		- ? Econ, sociology, polysci, psych, 
* Retired employees of 
  		- ATT
  		- PGE
  		- EBMUD
  		- Verizon
  		- Airports
  		- CalTrans
  		- Cities of Berkeley, Oakland, Alameda, Emeryville, Richmond
  		- All participants in Bay area design competition
  		- County of Alameda, Contra Costa, 
  		- UC
  			- faculty; 
  			- professional staff; 
  			- labs; 
  			- LBL; 
  			- Cross-index UCB grads with employers; use alumni association records, Berkeley fund lists; 
  			- Technology transfer offices: get all of them, from all universities, who's job is to track faculty innovations; 
  		- Create web site with people lists----can cross with political lists, voliunteer lists, NGO lists: ASK KATE
  		- DOD
  		- All Utilities
* UCB course assignments should be coordinated to build on class assignments that are relevant to infrastructure
  		- CED assignments in urban design
  		- Urbanism faculty: dig up old lists of cousess
  		- Jupyter notebook special 800 courses
* Engineering Societies
  		- Emergency and Disaster Society: who are they? Meet at I-House
  		- IEEE
  		- Mech Eng
  		- Civil Eng
  		- Environ Eng

### Case Studies

* German town that is energy self-sufficient
* Total Water Reuse towns: SF PUC
* plans for \[[David Warner]] fire prevention in urban-wild perimeter
* [ Kibera](kiberawater.com)
  		- All global slums: use everything
* Design of \[[Command and Control]] centers
  		- Military: Navy screens in San Diego
  			- visual, with audio alerts for moving objects, projected collisions
  		- Utilities
  			- California Transmission Command
  			- PG&E: E and G
  			- California Water Project
  			- San Francisco PUC building monitoring of use and reuse
  		- Amazon logistics
  		- Cyberterrorism Command
  		- National Targeting Command
  		- Space Junk monitoring
  		- Seismic detection of underground tests
  		- 
* Swiss Re
* ESRI: all GIS monitoring sites	

### Trace the flows

* Trace an electron
* Trace a drop of water
* Hydrological cycle; California flows cannot be separated from global flows; 
  		- track air moisture differential; show changes ;
* Truck roll
  		- long distance
  		- short distance
* Chart who owns; who pays taxes.......Fed, State, Local....

### Three parts

* physical
* network
* thought pattern
* money flow
* decision flow

### Control

* Valves
* Diverters
* Channels
