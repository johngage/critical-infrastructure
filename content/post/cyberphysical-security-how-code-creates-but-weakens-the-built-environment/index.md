### How systems are described as executable code

Emergene of metadata systems to develop interoperability among disparate systems, e.g., Brick, ASHRAE 223P;

Need to capture the interrelationships as:

* Composition: what contains what
* Connection, or topology: what connects to what. Needs to capture direction of flow; direction of information; temporal order;

  * Directed Acyclic Graphs for control
  * Cyclic graphs for interactions

Examples of existing systems for thousands of buildings

* Resource Description Framework (RDF): graph nodes; 

###### Chips

###### Boards

###### Computing Hardware

###### Virtual Environments

###### Mechanical devices

###### Built Environment

* Water systems
* Energy systems
* Buildinga

  * Existing communications protocols linking SCADA and other controllers to pumps, valves, transformers, switches:  all the elements of critical infrastructure

    * Building Management Systems: BACnet, Modbus, LonTalk or OPC
    * IoT: Bluetooth, WiFi, Zigbee, Enocean, Thread
  * HVAC: vents, piping, air handling--ASHRAE
  * Lighting
  * Water
  * Electrical
  * Spatial connectivity: stairs, hallways, open spaces, connective areas
