## Four Locations to model while building

<br>

1. **Blossom Street Neighborhood Association: Fruitvale, Oakland, CA**
    * First site to combine Brick+ building modeling software with actual construction and building operation
2.  Future site in Berkeley, CA
3.  **Kibera Town Centre, Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya**
    * First site to test 8 years of time series data for pumps, tanks, and energy flows with Mortar model of complete system flows
4. Future site: Kapenguria Peace Academy: remote rural Kenyan school with classrooms, dormitory, kitchen, and crop areas

These locations are the practical sites to test emerging cyberphysical models of the built environment. Each, in its own way, is on a trajectory to Net Zero energy, water, waste, and food flows.
