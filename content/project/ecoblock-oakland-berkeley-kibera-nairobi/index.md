## Locations to model while building representations of infrastructure

<br>

1. **Blossom Street Neighborhood Association: Fruitvale, Oakland, CA**
    * First site to combine Brick+ building modeling software with actual construction and building operation; ontology not established in detail, but could be a great example

2.  Future site in Berkeley, CA

3.  **Kibera Town Centre, Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya**
    * First site to test 8 years of time series data for pumps, tanks, and energy flows with Mortar model of complete system flows

4. Future site: Kapenguria Peace Academy: remote rural Kenyan school with classrooms, dormitory, kitchen, crop areas, irrigation, grazing

5. Richmond Field Station: existing sensing infrastructure for structural and geotechnic engineering; Bjarke Engels design site

These locations are practical sites to test emerging cyberphysical models of the built environment. Each, in its own way, is on a trajectory to Net Zero energy, water, waste, and food flows.
