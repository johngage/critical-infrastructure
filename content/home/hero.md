# Tools for Infrastructure Inventory, Design, and Resilience

Update: Thursday, September 22, 2022

- Updated Goal: To explore new tools for infrastructure inventory and design.
- With the arrival of new technologies of sensing, analysis and data discovery, a new landscape is emerging to understand the built environment. Today, we can build comprehensive digital models of structures, components, and their interactions. We can build ever-more-accurate models of flows of energy, water, heat, air, and chemical processes that affect these structures. 
- From this, we can analyze each structure, and the systems we build to support them, to guide investments in maintenance, repair, upgrade, redesign, demolition, and reconstruction. 
- This site will evolve as new systems of data capture and model design emerge. We draw from the disciplines of construction, civil engineering, urban design, environmental engineering, architecture, data science, and knowledge management.

# How Hard Infrastructure and Soft Code Merge in Cyberphysical Systems

## Steps: 
- Examine software-defined buildings and infrastructure for strengths and vulnerabilities. 
- Design an inventory of building and infrastructure stocks and flows. 
- Build models of decentralized water and power systems to serve that inventory.
- Generate a scope of work for each structure, each block, each neighborhood, each city, each utility. And, by extension, an outline of practices for builders, contractors, city planning entities, utility planners, and public utility commissions.
- Develop principles and practices of secure design. 
- Explore topology optimization. 
- Explore new curricula for the built environment.

## Resources to Support Research and Teaching About Critical Infrastructure In A Time Of Climate Crisis: Initial Steps

* Build data and data analysis surveying all components of critical infrastructure
* Create near and long-term policy analysis for all who own, invest in, design, build, operate, regulate, work in, or rely upon critical infrastructure.
* Develop curriculum for all elements of the critical infrastructure community, both in-person and on-line: utility management; journalists; regulators; operators;
* Establish public outreach, education, and participatory events to build better understanding of the challenges to our critical infrastructure
* Create specific task force commissions to focus on our most immediate challenges.
* Focus on NARUC: the United States organization of Public Utility Commissioners, whose standards combine with those of EU, China, and India to form international standards.
* Focus on international building codes.
* Focus on emerging technologies of energy generation and storage, water conservation and reuse, and utility tariff structure to encourage efficiency and conservation.
