## Resources to Support Research and Teaching About Critical Infrastructure In A Time Of Climate Crisis

* Build data and data analysis surveying all components of critical infrastructure
* Create near and long-term policy analysis for all who own, invest in, design, build, operate, regulate, work in, or rely upon critical infrastructure.
* Develop curriculum for all elements of the critical infrastructure community, both in-person and on-line: utility management; journalists; regulators; operators;
* Establish public outreach, education, and participatory events to build better understanding of the challenges to our critical infrastructure
* Create specific task force commissions to focus on our most immediate challenges.
* Focus on NARUC: the nation's Public Utility Commissioners
