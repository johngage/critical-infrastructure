# AMI Initiatives
Current AMI depend on outdated technology, both in physical sensors, communication standards, and computational environment. As a result, recent advances are not yet incorporated in designs, resulting in 5x to 10x more expensive equipment than is possible today--Fall, 2022
## Advances
- Sensor improvements: MEMS sensors: presssure, acceleration, rotation, impedence
- In-meter computation: advances in processsing power, reliability
- Inter-meter data consolidation: Near-range communications
- Encoding advances: density, security
- Spatial measurement: LiDAR, ground-penetrating radar, mechanical rigidity pipe sonar; water column signal transmission with signal processing;
### Architectural Advances
