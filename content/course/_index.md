We are building an international listing of courses provided by global universities addressing resilient infrastructure, security of cyberphysical structures, design, provability, auditing and testing, and pathways to capture today's infrastructure for analysis, upgrade, and repair.

Our goal is an international, multilingual syllabus available freely across the world.
